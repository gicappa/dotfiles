# Emacs
I've been using emacs at the beginning of my career when I used to
code in C and C++. Coding in Java for many years, led me to approach
to fancies IDEs tailored for the programming language.

I'm getting older now, and I wanted to have some fun again with the
configuration of a tools and I discovered again how Emacs is powerful
and how vast is its echosystem.

In the `emacs` directory I've saved the configuration files I created
but keep in mind that I'm an Emacs' n00b who is learning it starting
from the basics, and trying to tailor Emacs' configuration to my needs.
